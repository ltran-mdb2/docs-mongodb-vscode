The ``/schema`` command provides information about your collection
schema. The |copilot| accesses your connected MongoDB deployment to
provide schema information in the Copilot generated response. 

Examples
--------

Provide a Sample Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the ``users`` collection in the `Mflix Sample Database
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/#sample_mflix.users>`__.
If you are connected to the MongoDB deployment that contains this
collection, you can ask the |copilot| to provide a sample document. 

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /schema Can you show a sample document from the
   sample_mflix.users collection?

The GitHub Copilot Chat uses the |copilot| to
generate the following response using knowledge of your collection
schema:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Sure, here is a sample document from the sample_mflix.users
   collection:
   
   {
      "_id": {
         "$oid": "5f8473b823bca94021aa1c45"
      },
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "password": "password123",
      "preferences": {}
}

Once Copilot generates the response, you can open the JSON output to see
more information.
