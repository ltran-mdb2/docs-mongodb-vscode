The ``/schema`` command provides information about your collection
schema by accessing your connected MongoDB deployment.

Examples
--------

Provide a Sample Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses the ``users`` collection in the `Mflix Sample Database
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/#sample_mflix.users>`__.
Each document in the collection has the following structure:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id": {
         "$oid": "59b99db4cfa9a34dcd7885b6"
      },
      "name": "Ned Stark",
      "email": "sean_bean@gameofthron.es",
      "password": "$2b$12$UREFwsRUoyF0CRqGNK0LzO0HM/jLhgUCNNIJ9RJAqMUQ74crlJ1Vu"
   }


If you are connected to a MongoDB deployment that contains this
collection, you can ask the |copilot| to show the schema of your collection:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /schema @MongoDB /schema Can you show the schema for the
   sample_mflix.users collection?

GitHub Copilot uses the |copilot| to generate the following response:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   The schema for the sample_mflix.users collection, based on 100
   sampled documents, is as follows:

   {
      "_id": {
         "type": "ObjectId",
         "probability": 1
      },
      "email": {
         "type": "String",
         "probability": 1
      },
      "name": {
         "type": "String",
         "probability": 1
      },
      "password": {
         "type": "String",
         "probability": 1
      },
      "preferences": {
         "type": ["Document", "Undefined"],
         "probability": 0.01
      }
   }

   Key Points:

   - Fields _id, email, name, and password appear in all documents with
     a probability of 1.
   - The preferences field is mostly undefined but occasionally contains
     a document (1% probability).   

After Copilot generates the response, you can open the output in JSON format.
