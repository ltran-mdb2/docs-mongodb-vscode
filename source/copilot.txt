|vsce-full| includes a MongoDB Github Copilot Participant to assist in
using `Github Copilot <https://github.com/features/copilot>`__ with your
MongoDB deployments. Through Github Copilot's chat feature, users with
|vsce| can interact with their MongoDB clusters and generate code with
MongoDB domain-specific knowledge on top of Github Copilot's LLM. 

The MongoDB Github Copilot Participant includes MongoDB-specific
commands to assist in interacting with your deployment.

/query
------

The ``/query`` command assists in generating queries from a natural
language against a connected MongoDB cluster. The MongoDB Github Copilot
Participant provides underlying schema information of the relevant
collections to Github Copilot to generate a response. If you do not
specify a collection in your prompt, the chat prompts you to select a
relevant collection. 

When the LLM generates a query, you can open the query in a playground
file or run the query directly in your collection. 

Example
~~~~~~~

Consider the ``users`` collection in the `Mflix Sample Database
<`https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/#sample_mflix.users>`__.
Each document in the collection has the following structure:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      _id: {
         "$oid": "59b99db4cfa9a34dcd7885b6"
      },
      name: "Kayden Washington",
      email: "KW@email.com",
      password: "11222021"
   }
Once you connect to the deployment that contains the ``users``
collection, you can ask the Github Copilot chat to generate a query that
finds the document in the ``users`` collection that has the ``name``
value of `` "Kayden Washington"``. 

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /query find a document in the users collection with the name
   of Kayden Washington.

The Github Copilot Chat uses the MongoDB Github Copilot Participant to
generate the following query using knowledge of your database schema:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.getCollection('users').findOne({ name: 'Kayden Washington' });
