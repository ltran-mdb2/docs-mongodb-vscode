|vsce-full| automatically includes a MongoDB Github Copilot Participant
to assist in using Copilot with your MongoDB deployments. Through
Copilot's chat feature, users with |vsce| can interact their MongoDB
clusters and generate code with MongoDB domain-specific knowledge on top
of VSCode Copilot's LLM. 

/query
------

Users can use the ``/query`` command to generate queries from a natural
language against a connected MongoDB cluster. The MongoDB Participant
provides underlying schema information of the relevant collections and
MongoDB domain specific knowledge to Copilot to generate a response.
When the LLM generates a query, users can open the query in a playground
file or run the query directly in their collection.
