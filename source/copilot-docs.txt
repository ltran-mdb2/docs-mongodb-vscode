The ``/docs`` command provides MongoDB specific information to users,
supplemented by links to MongoDB Documentation. The |copilot| is
knowledgeable of the latest MongoDB Documentation and uses the
MongoDB Docs Chatbot API to link users to information in addition to
the textual response. 

Example
~~~~~~~

Consider the following prompt that asks for information on creating an
index in the GitHub Copilot chat:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /docs how do I create an index?

The chat first provides with the following links to MongoDB Documentation:

- `Create an Index <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/indexes/create-index/>`__
- `createIndexes <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/createIndexes/>`__
- `Getting Started with MongoDB and Java - CRUD Operations Tutorial <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/java/java-setup-crud-operations>`__
- `db.collection.createIndex() <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/>`__
   
The |copilot| also returns a textual response with information about
creating an index:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   To create an index in MongoDB, you can use the createIndex() method
   in the MongoDB Shell or the equivalent method for your specific
   driver. Here are examples for different programming languages:

   MongoDB Shell

      db.collection.createIndex({ <key and index type specification> }, { <options> })

   C#

      collection.CreateIndex(IndexKeys<collection>.<key and index type
      specification>, <options>);
      
   ...

   Indexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. If your
   application is repeatedly running queries on the same fields,
   creating an index on those fields can significantly improve
   performance. However, keep in mind that while indexes improve query
   performance, they can negatively impact write operations due to the
   additional overhead of maintaining the index.
