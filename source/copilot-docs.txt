The ``/docs`` command provides MongoDB-specific information,
supplemented by links to MongoDB Documentation. The |copilot| uses
Retrival-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate responses based on the
latest version of MongoDB Documentation.

Example
-------

The following prompt asks for information on creating an
index in the GitHub Copilot chat:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /docs how do I create an index?

The chat first provides the following MongoDB documentation:

- `Create an Index <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/indexes/create-index/>`__
- `createIndexes <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/createIndexes/>`__
- `Getting Started with MongoDB and Java - CRUD Operations Tutorial <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/java/java-setup-crud-operations>`__
- `db.collection.createIndex() <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/>`__
   
The |copilot| also returns a text response with information about
creating an index:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   To create an index in MongoDB, you can use the createIndex() method
   in the MongoDB Shell or the equivalent method for your specific
   driver. Here are examples for different programming languages:

   MongoDB Shell

      db.collection.createIndex({ <key and index type specification> }, { <options> })

   C#

      collection.CreateIndex(IndexKeys<collection>.<key and index type
      specification>, <options>);
      
   ...

   Indexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. If your
   application is repeatedly running queries on the same fields,
   creating an index on those fields can significantly improve
   performance. However, keep in mind that while indexes improve query
   performance, they can negatively impact write operations due to the
   additional overhead of maintaining the index.
