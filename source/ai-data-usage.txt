Third Party Providers
---------------------

The MongoDB Github Copilot Participant is powered by `Github Copilot <https://github.com/features/copilot>`__.
This is subject to change in the future. 

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you use the MongoDB Github Copilot Participant, the following
information is sent to MongoDB's backend and/or the third party AI
provider: 

- The full text of your natural language prompt.
- The schema of the collection you are using, 
  including database name, collection name, field names, and types. 

The information that is sent will not be shared with any other third 
parties or stored by the AI provider. We do not send database 
connection strings, credentials, or rows/documents from your databases.
